### Founding statment 
We are a collective of freelance designers. We founded dot collective because we believe collaboration is always at the heart of great design.

### About us
dot collective represents all of our shared knowledge and experties, covering a broad range of work. We are based in Pague but have experience working globally. We are a close group of friends who know each other through the Architectural Institute in Prague, as well as Design Disco. With our shared divers backgrounds and our collective tallents, we are able to achive highly creative, cost effective design through close interconnected collaboration.
