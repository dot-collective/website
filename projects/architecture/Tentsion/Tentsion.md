To provide a structure with all above requirements, which could house travelers overnight as a temporary summer structure. I turned to the insights of Bukminster Fuller on the relationship between tension and compression. Compression defies gravity best, while tension distributes loads the best. Using thin plywood sheets sewn together, the structure is in constant tension between the bent wood, and string stitching. 

The wood acts as a tension and compressive element providing structural stability. The stitching provides easy assembly on site from flat shipped panels. The resulted shape is both functional providing a fire place, surrounding seating and a sleeping platform behind. As well as being esthetic, with its natural cetenary curves. 

Tentsion is also sustainable; using formaldehyde free plywood, rough cut lumber, and natural fiber rope. Left alone in the woods, Tension would merely become part of the forest floor, decomposing into soil from where its materials came.
