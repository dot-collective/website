# projects

The projects folder is to be used for storing all work we post on the website's projects page. Please upload work with a text file containing all general info (client, site, date, etc..) and a description of the project in words. Along with it, photos, diagrams and drawings should represent the project fully. 

Place each new project in its own folder. This can be done by adding a new file and typing the project name followed by a forward slach like such / and then followed by a readme.md to define a text file with markdown editing. You will get the hang of this im sure.
